# jEdit Macros
Small collection of jEdit macros that I created that I thought might be worthwhile to others.

-Stu

### C/Include_Guard.sbh
Modification of the GPLd version of the one that is distributed with jEdit.
This version includes an extra extern "C" {} wrap.

### FindWordAtCursor.bsh
This does a search of whats under the cursor. I wanted a fast 'find it'
that was not a hypersearch.

### guid.bsh
Inserts a guid at the cursor

### reflow_text.bsh
Select a paragraph, this will reflow it to 76 columns, in future it should grab the buffer wrap size
but for now its a fixed value.

### unwrap.bsh
Unwraps a paragraph into one line
